# Zorakia
Material relating to roleplaying games set in the Kingdom of Zorakia

Mostly texts regarding the lore surrounding the games set in the particular part of the world. A wholly homebrew world which lends inspiration from great western fantasy worlds. The whole world is meant to echo your typical low-magic fantasy world, all the while drawing inspiration from folk lore to create a familiar, yet unique feeling.
